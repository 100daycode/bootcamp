                        Seasons Seychelles</h1>

                <div class="content-text">
                    <p>We were spending eight days in the Seychelles, and when we booked this trip many months ago, we
                        initially booked five nights at the Four Seasons Desroches Island, which was going to be the
                        “highlight” of our trip. I’ll talk more about that booking process when I review that hotel, but
                        we
                        booked a (publicly available) pre-opening rate there.

                        For our three nights on Mahe Island (the main island in the Seychelles) we didn’t know where we
                        wanted to stay. At first we were going to stay at the Le Meridien Fisherman’s Cove, but Tiffany
                        had
                        a not-great experience there. She said the Hilton Seychelles Northolme was much better, so we
                        were
                        looking at that. However, the rate was around 500EUR for our dates, and since Tiffany will
                        (hopefully) be reviewing that soon, I figured we should try something else.</p>
